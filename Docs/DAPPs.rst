DAPPs
====

To run a Distributed Application (DAPP) on the MOAC network,
you can deploy it on the MotherChain, or create a MicroChain for the DAPP.


Global DAPP Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For DAPPs on MotherChain, the deploy process is very similar as Ethereum.

If you have a DAPP running on Ethereum or similar platform, it's very easy to move it to MOAC platform.

MicroChain DApps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DApp runs on MicroChain means it has its own blockchain that supports transactions, 
data access, control flow in a layered structure. It creates the framework to allow users to execute
Smart Contract in an efficient way. It also provides the architecture to
spawn sub blockchains using underlying infrastructure quickly and
easily. It is a Blockchain platform with necessary plumbing parts
available to sub blockchains, providing solution for idea test, private
chain deployment, complex task processing, decentralized applications
etc.
