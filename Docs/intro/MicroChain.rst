MicroChain
^^^^^^^^^^

Using blockchain sharding technology, a MicroChain functions as a child blockchain within the platform that operates above the global MotherChain, and is responsible for Smart Contracts management. MicroChains also enable high volume transactions using a variety of consensus systems. Consensus system is an agreement system that provides accountability and verification of transactions.

The platform’s advanced layered Multi-blockchain architecture increases overall transaction processing speeds up to 100x faster (TPS) than existing blockchain platforms. Meanwhile, MicroChains enhance token concurrency rates up to 10,000 times, for a truly scalable solution.

MOAC is one of the first blockchain solutions to implement an unique MicroChain per Smart Contract, providing for efficiency and scalability beyond existing solutions. The MOAC Platform uses MicroChains to separate processing tasks and isolate blockchain functions from business logic for each individual smart contract. By providing each Smart Contract with its own unique MicroChain, it enables Smart Contracts to use a variety of consensus protocols and results in a wider range of potential business logic use cases.

Developers have the freedom to select the consensus protocol that best fits their use case and determine the number of nodes allocated to a specific Smart Contract. All the states of the Smart Contract are saved inside the local MicroChain™ and can write data to the MotherChain™ as needed for finality.

MicroChains significantly reduce the cost of smart contract operations and allow developers to rapidly test different application and service ideas. MOAC’s MicroChains are able to interconnect with all other non- MOAC blockchains using Cross-Chain capabilities. This allows both users and their decentralized applications (DApps) to migrate easily to the MOAC Platform, with no prior blockchain knowledge. It also provides a decentralized file storage solution (IPFS) which is currently missing from other major blockchains.
