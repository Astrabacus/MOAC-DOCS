Welcome to the MOAC Wiki!
--------------------------

Mother Of All Chains (MOAC) is to design a scalable and resilient
Blockchain that supports transactions, data access, control flow in a
layered structure. It creates the framework to allow users to execute
Smart Contract in an efficient way. It also provides the architecture to
spawn sub blockchains using underlying infrastructure quickly and
easily. It is a Blockchain platform with necessary plumbing parts
available to sub blockchains, providing solution for idea test, private
chain deployment, complex task processing, decentralized applications
etc.
